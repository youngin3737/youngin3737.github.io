I'm now a Master's Student in School of Copmuting, KAIST. I am currently part of the Human-Computer Interaction Lab (HCIL), advised by Professor Geehyuk Lee.

I am interested in discovering various Haptic Devices for VR and AR devices for more immersive and interesting user experiences.

### Research Interests

* VR/AR Interaction
* Haptic Devices
* VR Locomotion Techniques
* ML/DL

In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and [reverse](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout) (right sidebar), available via `<body>` classes
* [Eight optional color schemes](https://github.com/poole/hyde#themes), available via `<body>` classes
